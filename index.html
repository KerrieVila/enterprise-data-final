		<h1>A tale of two epidemics: <br> a comparison of HIV and Covid-19</h1>
		<p class="author">By Ruiqi Chen, Lucille Choi, and Kerrie Vila</p>

		<p>In the midst of a pandemic, it is easy to overlook the AIDS epidemic. After weeks in quarantine and a racial reckoning happening across the country, it makes sense that AIDS, a disease that peaked in 1993, is not at the forefront of the national conversation.</p>
		<p>But the reality is that AIDS has killed over 700,000 Americans and still takes about 13,000 lives a year, according to data from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/library/reports/hiv-surveillance-archive.html#2016-2010-Reports" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The initial government response to the epidemic has been widely acknowledged, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6004a11.htm" target="_blank">even by the CDC</a>, as a failure of the public health system. Now more than ever it is important not to make the same mistakes.</p>

		<figcaption>All 50 states and Puerto Rico started tracking AIDS cases and rates in 1985. The initial outbreaks were in highly populated states such as New York, California and Florida but it quickly spread across the country. In 1993 the CDC refined the case definition for AIDS and many people who had been living with the disease, but not previously included in the count were reclassified which accounts for the high rates that year. Even as testing and prevention measures got more advanced the rate of AIDS has remained higher in the southern states.</figcaption>

		<p>The term AIDS was first defined in 1982 after doctors discovered a new blood disorder primarily in gay men across the country. President Ronald Reagan did not mention the disease publicly for three years and did not directly address the ongoing crisis in a speech until 1987, after the CDC had recorded the death of over 16,000 Americans.</p>
		<p>It would take until 1997, fifteen years after AIDS was discovered, for the US to see a drop in overall deaths year over year, according to the CDC. In today’s terms, that’s as if the number of COVID-19 deaths continued to increase steadily until 2035.</p>
		<p>This comparison is not one-to-one. The transmission of AIDS and COVID-19 are extremely different, and they have different incubation periods and attack different systems in the body. COVID-19 can have relatively mild cases whereas AIDS is chronic. But by looking at the government’s response to AIDS, it is possible to understand how public health has, or hasn't, changed.</p>
		<p>AIDS revealed the cracks in the U.S. health system and its tendency to ignore minority communities, who are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. According to the Center for American Progress in 2016, African Americans, who make up only 14% of the U.S. population, made up 44% of the HIV-positive population. Gay men represented 2% of the U.S. population at the time but accounted for 61% of all new HIV infections, and Latinos faced three times the HIV infection rates as whites. Today, minority groups continue to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. While Black people still make up roughly 14% of the population, they are nearly three times more likely to die of COVID-19 than other racial demographics.</p>
		<p>The AIDS epidemic showed the importance of a centralized public response, robust testing programs, research funding, health education and community responses to outbreaks. Lessons learned at the federal and state level during the AIDS epidemic should be informing the public health system during the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

		<figcaption>DC and Puerto Rico have been two of the hardest hit areas by AIDS. Both territories have large low-income minority communities and a harder time getting access to federal resources because of their secondary status. This chart shows that while northeastern states were initially hard hit, southern states including Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi have struggled with above average rates in the past decade.</figcaption>


		<p>While individual states began reporting cases of AIDS as early as 1983, it took some time for the federal government to catch up. </p>
		<p>“The federal response to AIDS by comparison (to state responses) was stunning,” said Catherine Hanssens, the founder of the Center for HIV Law and Policy. “It's stunning by comparison in that there was so little, and we're not just talking about a few weeks or months. We're talking about years.”</p>
		<p>Hanssens recalled that LGBTQ rights activist Urvashi Vaid interrupted a speech by former President George H. W. Bush in 1990, nearly a decade after the epidemic began, to advocate for federal AIDS research and treatment funding. Vaid was escorted out of the event by the secret service.</p>
		<p>Though many state and federal health organizations such as the Center for Disease Control began tracking cases of AIDS in 1983 through its annual HIV Surveillance Reports, it wasn’t until 2011 that all 50 states and five U.S. territories reported infection rates and new diagnoses of both HIV and AIDS.</p>
		<p>The CDC’s guidelines for reporting have also changed over the years, leading to various anomalies in the data that might be misleading, said Hanssens.</p>
		<p>For example, the number of AIDS cases in the U.S. appeared to double between 1992 and 1993, which might seem to indicate a massive outbreak that year. In reality, the spike occurred because the CDC expanded the definition of AIDS and HIV in 1993 to include various additional physiological symptoms as well as women with HIV or AIDS, who were previously not counted in the CDC’s reporting. </p>

		<figcaption>Caption: The CDC did not start recording the rate of HIV in states until 1993, and it was not until 2011 that all 50 states reported HIV rate. Similar to the rate of AIDS, southern states have had higher HIV rates in recent years.</figcaption>

		<p>In addition to inconsistent tracking and reporting of the disease throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the first major federal strategy to combat the epidemic was not introduced until 2010, two years into the Obama Administration, said Lindsey Dawson, the associate director of HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>
		<p>The National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States was passed in July 2010, nearly three decades and over half a million deaths after the AIDS epidemic began, and it aimed to drive down new infections, improve access to treatment and reduce HIV-related health disparities.</p>
		<p>Since then, the Trump Administration has announced its 2019 initiative “Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America” which aims to reduce infections 75% by 2025. Looking back, however, most administrations were far less eager to address the epidemic.</p>
		<p>“The (Reagan Administration) was not excited to help gay men. They were very connected with the ‘Religious Rights,’” said Alan Witchey, CEO of The Damien Center, Indiana’s oldest and largest AIDS service organization.</p>
		<p>Witchey, who has been volunteering with the center since the 80’s, believed that the turning point was 1990 The Ryan White Care Act, named after a teenager from Kokomo, Indiana, who stepped up and changed everyone’s perception of AIDS.</p>
		<p>“Funding was provided and medication has changed dramatically,” Witchey said. Under the Ryan White Care Act, there were 3 main funding streams, some of which were for geographic regions that had a certain number of cases. Witchey’s own state, Indiana, did not receive much funding initially because they started with fewer cases than required by the act. </p>
		<p>“Our state was not terribly responsive. There was some federal funding that required our state to put a matching funding for insurance premium and medication,” Witchey said. “Earlier, not everyone could get that. You are lucky to be able to get it. It was definitely more complicated (back in the 80’s). For today, as long as you meet the federal poverty level, we can get you insurance, that’s not a problem.”</p>
		<p>He contrasted the situation in Indiana to that of California, where he served as the CEO of AIDS Services Foundation from 2003 to 2008. </p>
		<p>“California was a state that had more cases that brought in more funding from the federal government. The state and the county also provided money and services (more so than Indiana),” Witchey said. “From a funding perspective, it isn’t very different today. California is a Democratic state, Indiana is a Republican state, the difference (in which party is in power) leads to the difference in the amount of funding that becomes available.” </p>

		<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/2613611" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/2613611/embed"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
		<figcaption>The rate of AIDS in almost all 50 states, DC and Puerto Rico peaked in 1993 when the CDC refined the case definitions of AIDS and HIV, but since then some states like New York have had a steep decline in the rate of AIDS, while other states including Tennessee have had a slower decline. Georgia even saw a second peak in 2012.</figcaption>

		<p>However, Witchey was hesitant to claim that political parties were directly tied to HIV/AIDS responses. </p>
		<p>“I don’t want to make it simply about politics. There are examples from all sides, where there is good programming. There is a lot of ‘along the lines’ politics,” Witchey said. “Democrats really believe in trying to get social services to low-income populations. Oftentimes, Republican believe in bringing capitalist structure, so that capitalism ... will lead to the creation of income that will lead to more services.”</p>
		<p>Witchey also noted that HIV heavily affects African American and Latinx populations, which are also disproportionately low-income. These additional nuances often lead state and federal officials to treat the epidemic as a political issue, but, “It really should be more of a human issue,” Witchey said.</p>
		<p>The Obama and Trump Administrations’ more recent pushes to end the HIV epidemic are the result of decades of advocacy and litigation by people like Witchey and Hanssens of the Center for HIV Law and Policy, who have been working in this area since the 1980s, but the world can’t afford such slow progress when combating the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
		<p>“The biggest lesson is when you move slow, people die. When you move quicker, more people live,” Witchey said. “That’s true (for the HIV epidemic) and for the COVID epidemic too. For COVID, there was no testing, we couldn’t get our clients and staff tested. People didn’t even know they had COVID. In HIV, earlier, there was no test at all.”</p>

			<figcaption>These charts show the progress of the AIDS epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. Although they are over very different time periods, decades and months respectively, looking at the trends can reveal interesting patterns. For example, in both charts New York’s is hit very hard and early, but levels off before other states. Similarly, states including Nevada and Georgia are initially spared in both but have a harder time slowing the trend after it starts.
</figcaption>

		<p>COVID-19 spreads similarly to the flu or the common cold rather than through sexual contact or blood, according to the CDC, making the average person much more susceptible to COVID-19 than HIV. While the AIDS epidemic reached the sobering milestone of 100,000 deaths eight years after the first cases were diagnosed, CVOID-19’s U.S. death toll reached that number within three months.</p>
		<p>The New York Times paid tribute to the 100,000 victims of COVID-19 with a full-spread front page filled with names and descriptions of the dead. But when the same number of people died of AIDS, the New York Times tucked the story on page 18 of the paper under the fold.</p>
		<p>“I thought that HIV was a complicated disease. It’s really simple compared to what’s going on with COVID-19,” said Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the country’s leading infectious disease expert, in a June 6 statement.</p>
		<p>Fauci has become a household name due to his work on the COVID-19 pandemic, but his career also includes decades of work on HIV and AIDS. Since 1984, Fauci has advised six presidents on federal HIV/AIDS response and has conducted extensive research on HIV, according to his NIAIC biography. During his Tuesday comments, Fauci added that unlike COVID-19, HIV was never a disease that threatened the whole world. </p>
		<p>“I see so many similarities to when I first started working in HIV,” said Stephen Everett, the vice president of programs for the Health Foundation of Indianapolis. He said the current lack of sufficient COVID-19 tests and concrete treatments reminds him of the AIDS epidemic in the 1990s. In addition, Everett and Hanssens of the Center for HIV Law and Policy emphasized the importance, and often lack, of collaboration between federal and state governments during public health crises. </p>
		<p>“Part of the problem is the bystander-ish nature of too many of our state and federal public health authorities,” Hanssens said. She added that state and federal health authorities should be proactive in handling public health crises such as the AIDS epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
		<p>Instead of policing people for having sex or not social distancing, Hanssesns said, “Let's have crews of people handing out masks. Somebody doesn't have a mask, give them a mask. Don't arrest them.”</p>
		<p>The new pandemic has also limited the country’s HIV/AIDS healthcare resources. Dawson said many HIV care facilities have also stopped offering the preventive medication PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, due to social distancing restrictions. </p>
		<p>But there is a silver lining. Many professionals who have extensive experience in HIV and AIDS and other infectious disease contact tracing have temporarily lent their expertise to working on combating and tracking COVID-19, according to both Dawson and Everett.</p>
		<p>“That's the beauty of the work that we've done in the last 35, 40 years in HIV,” Everett said. “People are willing to do what's necessary to figure out what's best for serving people who are infected, and gently, sometimes relentlessly, going about figuring out the best way to move that process forward.”</p>
